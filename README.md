# git-issue

* list issues (bitbucket ✔, github ✔, gitlab ✔)
* create issue (bitbucket ✔, github ✔, gitlab ✔)
* delete issue (bitbucket ✔, github ✔ (n/a), gitlab ✔ (n/a))
* cli integration ⋯

Why? There's excellent tools for GitHub out there, but I found integration for BitBucket or Gitlab lacking.

# Installation

You can build the gem and install it on your system:

    gem build git-issues.gemspec
    gem install *gem

# Security

Your login information will be stored by default in: `~/.git-issues.conf`. Make sure to keep this file's permissions limited (e.g. `0600`).

If you can, **do not use username and password** for login. Use OAuth instead. If you use username and password, both will be stored in the configuration file in an unencrypted state, which is highly discouraged.

How to get OAuth tokens:

* GitHub: Go to _Account Settings_, _Applications_, and click on _Create a new Personal Access Token_. Enter `git-issues` as the description. Use this token during first login.
* [OAuth on BitBucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/OAuth+on+Bitbucket)
* Gitlab: Click on your profile, _Profile Settings_, _Account_ and use the _Private token_ found here.
